# Restaurant One-Pager

As part of [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com) curriculum I created a one-pager informational website for a fictional restaurant - Vesuvio (of [The Sopranos](https://sopranos.fandom.com/wiki/Vesuvio) fame).

The site uses ES6 modules to dynamically render different pages using a navbar.

I was able to practice using WebPack to roll up the modules and assets for maximum browser compatibility.

A live preview of the website is available [here](https://s111ew.github.io/odin-restaurant-page/).

Stack:
• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript
• npm
• WebPack
• Git
